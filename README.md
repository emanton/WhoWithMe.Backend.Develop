# WhoWithMe
Everyday doing some stuff when I have a free time!)

Social network
Main purpose:
Create events, for which other people can subscribe

UI was supposed to be in react native. And not to be in this repository.
But currently want to quickly implement it by React in folder "web-client". 

Currently playing a lot of with Git Copilot and making a lot of restructorization/refactoring stuff. 
That`s why commits lately are very messy! Sorry for it.

Hope, I will find a time soonly to esteblish order here! See you!
