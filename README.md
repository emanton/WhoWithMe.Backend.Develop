Everyday doing some stuff when I have a free time!)

UI was supposed to be in react native. And not to be in this repository.
But currently want to quickly implement it by React in folder "web-client". 

Currently playing a lot of with Git Copilot and making a lot of restructorization/refactoring stuff. 
That`s why commits lately are very messy! Sorry for it.

Hope, I will find a time soonly to esteblish order here! See you! 



**Current progress**
I have found a new thing for me during Visual studio installation - Git Copilot AI xD

I used AI previously, but now I almost do not do programming. Instead, I am studing how to work with AI to implement most part of tasks. (Writing what I need, Checking what AI generated, Testing -> and again)

I know, AI still make many mistakes. But it does monitoring, investigating, refactoring much faster then me. 

So, I am currently playing with AI and trying make it to create for me react UI application. It very quickly created API calls to existing endpoints, basic CRUD logic. But UI is very bad. Working on it... xD
