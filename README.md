# SkillFindingService

This is a project for my diploma. It is for finding a job.

There are 2 types of users:
1) workers;
2) clients,

A worker can register in this service. Then, fill some information about him and choose skills which he can do.

A client can write in the search field some nessesary service, which he needs. Then, he will see the most suitable people, who can help him.
