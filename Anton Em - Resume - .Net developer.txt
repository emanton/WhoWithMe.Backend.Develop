I took part in different projects using frontend technologies such as JS, React, AngularJS (25% of my experience) and backend technologies such as ASP.Net WebAPI, ASP.Net Core (75% of my experience). To work with database I usually used EntityFramework, but also had experience to work with MSSql directly like creating tables, procedures, functions. For code version control I mainly worked with Git.
